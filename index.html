  <h2> About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hi! My name is Maya Hofman. I'm from Long Island, New York. I'm a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying
   Retail and Consumer Behavior and pursuing certificates in Graphic Design, Digital Studies, and
   Entrepreneurship. In school, I have been immersed in many different classes, such
   as Graphic Design, Two-Dimensional Design, Retailing, Digital Media Production, and Digital Information, which have
   inspired me to pursue new artistic opportunities.
